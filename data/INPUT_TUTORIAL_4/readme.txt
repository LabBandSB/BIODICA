These are the results of application of several matrix factorization methods 
(ICA, StabilizedICA, NMF, PCA) for a set of 14 independent colon cancer 
transcriptomics datasets. The analysis was done to compare the methods 
in terms of their reproducibility (ability to generalize). 

The results of this analysis were published in 

Cantini L, Kairov U, de Reynies A, Barillot E, Radvanyi F, Zinovyev A. 
Assessing reproducibility of matrix factorization methods in independent 
transcriptomes. Bioinformatics. 2019 Nov 1;35(21):4307-4313.
