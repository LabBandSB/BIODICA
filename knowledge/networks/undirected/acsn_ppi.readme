Here is ACSN converted into a PPI-like database.

Each node in ACSN can correspond to several HUGO names.

The sif file describes pairwise interactions.

The gmt file describes relations between the node names in ACSN
and the HUGO names, in the gmt format
(second column is description of a dataset which is always "na"
in this case).
